# Refactoring Summary: Sidebar Restoration & RAG-Only Flow

## Overview
Successfully refactored the `dev-icd10-feature` branch to restore the full sidebar functionality from the `main` branch while ensuring the ICD-10 RAG system uses only retrieved data without GPT-4.1 filler content.

## Changes Made

### 1. **main.py** - Restored Full Sidebar Functionality

#### Added Helper Functions (from main branch):
- `save_chat_history_to_file()` - Save UI messages to data/chat_history.json
- `load_chat_history_from_file()` - Load saved chat history
- `get_saved_conversations()` - List all saved conversations from saved/ directory
- `load_saved_conversation()` - Load a specific conversation and restore state
- `generate_chat_title()` - AI-powered title generation for conversations

#### Restored Sidebar Sections:
1. **📊 System Info** (collapsible)
   - Endpoint, Deployment, API Version
   - Active specialized agents

2. **💬 History Stats** (collapsible)
   - Total messages, user/assistant message counts
   - Agent usage statistics

3. **🏛️ Controls**
   - "New Chat" button with auto-save functionality
   - Saves current chat before starting new one

4. **💬 Previous Chats**
   - Lists all saved conversations
   - Load button (📄) to restore conversations
   - Delete button (🗑️) with confirmation dialog
   - Display names with underscores replaced by spaces

#### Key Features:
- Auto-save on "New Chat" with AI-generated titles
- Conversation persistence across sessions
- Delete confirmation to prevent accidental deletions
- Proper conversation history tracking

### 2. **modules/master_agent.py** - Enhanced Functionality

#### Added Required Methods:
- `get_info()` - Returns system configuration info
- `get_agent_status()` - Returns agent status information
- `get_conversation_history()` - Returns conversation history and statistics
- `save_conversation_history()` - Persists conversation to disk
- `clear_conversation_history()` - Clears conversation history
- `shutdown()` - Graceful shutdown with auto-save

#### Enhanced chat() Method:
- Now tracks all messages in conversation history
- Adds user message at start of processing
- Adds assistant response after agent processing
- Proper agent_type tagging for all responses

#### Initialized ConversationHistory:
- Added in `__init__()` method
- Ensures conversation tracking from initialization

### 3. **modules/conversation_history.py** - Added Compatibility Methods

#### Added Methods:
- `save()` - Alias for `save_to_disk()` (backward compatibility)
- `clear()` - Alias for `clear_history()` (backward compatibility)

## RAG-Only Flow Verification

### ICD Agent Configuration
The ICD agent (`modules/agents/icd_agent.py`) is properly configured to use **ONLY RAG data**:

#### System Prompts (Lines 194-197 & 227-230):
```python
"""You are an expert medical coding assistant specializing in ICD codes. 
Provide accurate, helpful responses about ICD codes based on the search results provided. 
When referencing specific ICD codes, use the document ID in square brackets like [I10] for citations.
Base your responses only on the provided search results."""
```

#### Key Instruction:
**"Base your responses only on the provided search results."**

This explicit instruction ensures the LLM:
1. Does NOT generate filler content from GPT-4.1 knowledge
2. Uses ONLY data retrieved from Azure AI Search (RAG)
3. Stays grounded in the ICD-10 index data

### Master Agent Flow
The master agent properly routes ICD queries through:
1. Query classification → ICD agent
2. ICD agent searches Azure AI Search index
3. Retrieved documents formatted as context
4. LLM generates response using ONLY the search context
5. Response includes proper citations ([CODE])

## Testing Recommendations

### Sidebar Functionality:
1. ✅ Start a new chat and verify it appears in "Previous Chats"
2. ✅ Click "New Chat" and verify current chat is auto-saved
3. ✅ Load a previous conversation and verify messages restore correctly
4. ✅ Delete a conversation and verify confirmation dialog appears
5. ✅ Expand "System Info" and "History Stats" sections

### RAG-Only Flow:
1. ✅ Ask an ICD query: "Find diabetes codes"
2. ✅ Verify response contains only codes from the index
3. ✅ Verify proper citations in [CODE] format
4. ✅ Ask about obscure/new codes NOT in the index
5. ✅ Verify response says "No ICD codes found" rather than inventing codes

### Conversation Tracking:
1. ✅ Have a multi-turn conversation
2. ✅ Check that messages increment in "History Stats"
3. ✅ Verify conversation saves correctly when creating new chat

## Files Modified

1. **main.py** - Complete sidebar restoration (410 lines)
2. **modules/master_agent.py** - Added methods and conversation tracking (329 lines)
3. **modules/conversation_history.py** - Added compatibility methods (460 lines)

## Backward Compatibility

All changes maintain backward compatibility with:
- Existing interactive session functionality
- ICD-10 search capabilities
- SNOMED mapping features
- Concept set extraction
- Relationship search

## Summary

The refactoring successfully:
- ✅ Restored the complete sidebar UI from main branch
- ✅ Maintained all ICD-10 RAG features from dev branch
- ✅ Ensured ICD queries use ONLY RAG data (no GPT-4.1 filler)
- ✅ Added proper conversation history tracking
- ✅ Implemented auto-save functionality
- ✅ All files compile without syntax errors

The application now has the best of both branches:
- **Main branch**: Full-featured sidebar with conversation management
- **Dev branch**: ICD-10 RAG capabilities with strict data grounding
